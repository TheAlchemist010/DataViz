                            <p>Throughout the 1970s, Australia began to see a rise in environmental concern from the general public. 1970 marked the first global Earth Day, and the mid-70s saw some of the first major environmental activism. Much of this activism focused on dam projects, such as Lake Pedder and the Franklin Dam. The 1970s also saw foundational research into the greenhouse effect and pollution, including the observation that the globe was warming. Though the rate of warming seemed minor in the 70s, today the climate is rapidly heating.</p>

		            <p>In 2000, coal dominated Australia's electricity generation, marking the peak of coal-powered energy. Black and brown coal plants produced the bulk of electricity, with solar and wind still in their infancy. While the environmental costs of coal were increasingly recognized, investments in renewable energy were minimal. However, this period laid the groundwork for a shift toward renewables that would slowly gain momentum in the coming decades, leading to a gradual decline in coal use.</p>

                            Australia also implemented several policies aimed at reducing emissions, such as a <b>carbon tax</b> and an <b>emissions trading scheme</b>. During this time, environmentalism was becoming increasingly popular, and most Australians agreed that stricter emissions standards and more investment in renewables were necessary.</p>

Before this, Australia's carbon emissions and investment in fossil fuels had been slowly declining. The repeal of these policies caused a significant spike, reversing progress in the country's energy transition. Even in 2013, the majority of Australia's power was still generated from coal.

		            <p>In 2020, despite the global economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia achieved a record year for fossil fuel exports. This included massive shipments of coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG), particularly to countries like China, Japan, and South Korea. While Australia has committed to reducing domestic emissions, its role as a major fossil fuel exporter highlights a significant contradiction. Even if Australia achieves net-zero emissions domestically, it continues to support global fossil fuel consumption, contributing to emissions abroad.</p>

This boom is driven by declining renewable costs and global commitments to cut emissions. However, some fossil fuel projects, like new gas plants, are still being built for energy stability. As the shift to clean energy progresses, Australia faces the challenge of managing grid reliability while continuing to expand its renewable capacity.</p>
