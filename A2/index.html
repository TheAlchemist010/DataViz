                            <p>Throughout the 1970s, Australia began to see a rise in environmental concern from the general public. 1970 marked the first global Earth Day, and the mid-70s saw some of the first major environmental activism. Much of this activism focused on dam projects, such as Lake Pedder and the Franklin Dam. The 1970s also saw foundational research into the greenhouse effect and pollution, including the observation that the globe was warming. Though the rate of warming seemed minor in the 70s, today the climate is rapidly heating.</p>

		            <p>At the dawn of the 21st century, Australia reached its highest level of coal-powered electricity generation, marking the peak of coal usage in the country. Black and brown coal remained dominant in Australia's energy landscape, with coal-fired power plants providing the majority of electricity. Despite some early discussions about renewable energy, solar and wind power were almost non-existent during this time. 
		            </p>
		            <p>However, the seeds of change were being planted, driven by new technological advancements and growing awareness of the environmental costs of coal. Investments in alternative energy sources began to take shape, but the reliance on coal remained high. This period set the stage for the transition that would intensify in the decades that followed, as coal would eventually be seen not as the future, but a relic of the past.</p>

                            Australia also implemented several policies aimed at reducing emissions, such as a <b>carbon tax</b> and an <b>emissions trading scheme</b>. During this time, environmentalism was becoming increasingly popular, and most Australians agreed that stricter emissions standards and more investment in renewables were necessary.</p>

Before this, Australia's carbon emissions and investment in fossil fuels had been slowly declining. The repeal of these policies caused a significant spike, reversing progress in the country's energy transition. Even in 2013, the majority of Australia's power was still generated from coal.

		    <h2>2020: Record Year for Fossil Fuel Exports</h2>
		    <div class="pure-g">
		        <div class="pure-u-1-3">
		            <p>In 2020, despite the global economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia achieved a record year for fossil fuel exports. This included massive shipments of coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG), particularly to countries like China, Japan, and South Korea. While Australia has committed to reducing domestic emissions, its role as a major fossil fuel exporter highlights a significant contradiction. Even if Australia achieves net-zero emissions domestically, it continues to support global fossil fuel consumption, contributing to emissions abroad.</p>

		            <p>Though most of Australia's energy still comes from fossil fuels today, the trend toward renewable energy is accelerating. The vast majority of upcoming and in-construction projects are renewables, such as solar, wind, and battery storage. The rapid growth of renewables is spurred by both global and local commitments to tackle climate change and the declining cost of renewable technologies.
		            </p>
		            <p>Nonetheless, fossil fuels are not completely gone. New gas plants, such as the Reeves Plains Power Station, are still being constructed, with their proponents arguing that natural gas is necessary for grid stability. As the world transitions to cleaner energy, Australia's challenge will be to completely phase out fossil fuels while managing energy reliability and continuing to support a growing renewable sector. The future may be renewable, but the transition is far from over.</p>
